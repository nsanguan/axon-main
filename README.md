# 🧠 Axon

### **The Open-Source Agentic Advance Supply Chain Planning OS (Pure MCP Architecture)**

**Axon** is a next-generation Supply Chain Planning (ASCP) framework built for the **Agentic AI era**. Unlike legacy systems that rely on direct database connections, Axon is **100% MCP-native**. It is designed as an **AI-native planning and orchestration layer** that sits above ERP systems and turns demand, inventory, procurement, and operational signals into coordinated decisions and actionable workflows.

In practical terms, Axon is an **agentic supply chain planning nerve system for modern ERPs**: it connects ERP execution, planning logic, and multi-agent reasoning without coupling the core planning engine to any one system of record.

## 🌟 Key Strategic Features

* **100% MCP-Native Architecture**: No direct DB connections (JDBC/ORDS). All systems—Oracle EBS, SAP, Odoo, and LLMWiki—interface via the **Model Context Protocol**.
* **Plug-and-Play Connectors**: Swap between different ERP versions or vendors simply by switching the MCP host.
* **External Knowledge Mesh**: LeveLLMWikies your **External LLMWiki MCP Server** to verify every plan against corporate SOPs and legal constraints.
* **Universal Semantic Schema**: A unified Pydantic-based data language (`axon.core.schema`) that translates diverse MCP tool outputs into a single planning context.
* **Autonomous Negotiation**: A LangGraph-powered "Conflict Resolution" engine where 10+ departmental agents negotiate to find the highest utility outcome.
* **Self-Improving Logic**: An Experience Ledger that records the performance of AI-generated plans to refine future reasoning.
* **ERP-Agnostic Planning Layer**: Works as a decision and orchestration layer above systems like Oracle EBS, SAP, and Odoo rather than replacing them.
* **Human-in-the-Loop Ready**: Designed for approval gates, explainability, and enterprise-safe operational decision support.

---

## 🚀 Why Axon

Most systems solve only one part of the operational planning problem:

* **ERPs** are good at recording and executing transactions.
* **Planning tools** are good at generating forecasts or recommendations.
* **Agent frameworks** are good at orchestrating AI workflows.

But supply chain teams need all three to work together.

Axon bridges that gap by combining:

* **planning intelligence**
* **workflow orchestration**
* **ERP-connected execution context**
* **agentic decision support**

That makes Axon more than an ERP integration and more than a generic agent framework — it is a **planning brain and coordination layer** for supply chain operations.

10. **Maintenance**: Predictive Downtime & Asset Health

---

## 🧭 Competitive Positioning

Axon sits at the intersection of:

* **supply chain planning**
* **ERP operations**
* **agentic AI orchestration**

Compared with systems like **Odoo**, **ERPNext**, **OpenBoxes**, **Apache OFBiz**, and **Tryton**, Axon focuses on the layer above transaction execution: **decision-making, planning orchestration, and intelligent operational coordination**.

Compared with general-purpose agent systems like **PraisonAI** or **OpenAgentsControl**, Axon is **domain-specific** and designed around the realities of supply chain workflows and ERP-connected environments.

In short:

* **ERP systems** execute transactions.
* **Inventory systems** manage stock and movement.
* **Agent frameworks** orchestrate generic AI workflows.
* **Axon** connects planning intelligence, workflow coordination, and ERP-aware decision-making.

### **Phase 2: ERP Perception Mesh (Month 2)**

* Integrate **Oracle EBS MCP Server** (Standardized tool-based access to MTL/WIP).
* Integrate SAP and Odoo MCP Servers.
* Build the **Semantic Transformer** to cast MCP JSON outputs into Axon Schema.

### **Phase 3: Cognitive Logic & Conflict (Month 3-4)**

* Deploy 10 Specialized Agents with **LLMWiki-augmented reasoning**.
* Develop the **Conflict Resolution Engine** to handle cross-departmental "deadlocks" (e.g., Maintenance vs. Production).
* Implement the **Utility Engine** to calculate the best plan based on Business Weights.

### **Phase 4: Feedback & Control (Month 5)** ✅

* Launch **Admin Control Tower** for real-time strategic weight tuning. ✅
* Activate the **Experience Ledger** to log the success/failure of plans. ✅
* Enable **Human-in-the-loop (HITL)** for final plan approvals. ✅
* PostgreSQL-backed `axon_brain` schema (experience_records, memory_store, plan_traces). ✅
* Async `ExperienceLedger` with JSONB codec, `search_path=axon_brain`, semantic similarity retrieval. ✅

### **Phase 5: Scale & Governance (Month 6+)** ✅

* Secure Bi-directional MCP tool-calls for ERP write-backs. ✅
* Finalize RBAC and AI Guardrails for enterprise safety. ✅
* Escalation architecture: 4-tier ladder (Worker→Manager→Director→Executive). ✅

## 🧪 How to Run Tests

### Python Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
pytest

# Run a specific test file
pytest tests/test_schema.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Lint & Type Check

```bash
# Lint
ruff check src/ tests/

# Format check
ruff format --check src/ tests/

# Type check
mypy src/

# All checks (before committing)
ruff check src/ tests/ && ruff format --check src/ tests/ && mypy src/ && pytest
```

### Scenario Tests (Integration Simulation)

Scenarios are Markdown files in `tests/scenarios/` describing supply chain disruptions in **Gherkin-style** (Given-When-Then). Each scenario defines:

- **Given (Context)**: Current state — inventory, orders, capacity
- **When (Trigger)**: The disruption event
- **Then (Expected Behavior)**: MCP tools to call, solutions to generate, HITL decisions

```bash
# List available scenarios
python scripts/test_runner.py --list

# Dry-run all scenarios (parse + display without invoking orchestrator)
python scripts/test_runner.py --dry-run

# Run a single scenario
python scripts/test_runner.py tests/scenarios/delay_shipment_po.md
```

**Available scenarios:**

| File | Type | Severity |
|------|------|----------|
| `delay_shipment_po.md` | Procurement / Supply Delay | Critical |
| `machine_breakdown.md` | Production / Equipment Failure | Critical |
| `demand_spike.md` | Sales / Demand Surge | High |
| `inventory_shortage.md` | Warehouse / Raw Material Shortage | High |
| `escalation_production_breakdown.md` | Escalation / Multi-tier | Critical |
| `escalation_stock_check.md` | Escalation / Inventory Review | High |

To add a new scenario, create a `tests/scenarios/<name>.md` file following the Gherkin-style template.
The `scripts/test_runner.py` auto-discovers all `.md` files in the directory.

**Architect's Note:**
By going **Strictly MCP**, you've made the system incredibly clean. The `src/axon/connectors/mcp_oracle_ebs/` 
module no longer contains SQL or JDBC drivers; instead, it contains **Tool Definitions** and **Response Parsers**.
This is the most future-proof way to build AI-driven enterprise software.
